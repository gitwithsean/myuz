There are bards. druids, craftspeople, and storytellers. some of whom provide comfort, storytelling, examples of human tenderness, beauty and insight. There is a mixture of Christianity and Celtic/Pagan beliefs. The truly ancient sacred and divine places (e.g. Newgrange) make the stories of a son of god (Christ) from a faraway land harder to take seriously. The narrator is aware of this tension, however most of the characters are untroubled by their mixed holding of these beliefs. Each side (christian / pagan) does have militants who can cause trouble for our protagonists, but their beliefs make them easy to manipulate, and in some cases their beliefs make them helpful. The book draws from the political, social and environmental history of Ireland in those years. It also draws from ancient Irish mythology. The growing port of Dublin (Dubh Linn), the building of Christchurch Cathedral there. The story The Cattle Raid of Cooley (Táin Bó Cúailnge) dates back to the Iron Age, but its written form in Old Irish was likely created in the 11th or 12th century. It was a very popular epic tale of rivalry, war, and heroism"
