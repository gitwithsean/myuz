Allow the sentences to flow together, making the continuity and intensity of the prose dreamlike (more often, nightmare like). Favor run-on sentences that bring a relentless pace to the prose with very few commas. but also employ occasional sentence fragments.\n* Write long, complex sentences: Construct sentences with multiple clauses and ideas, letting them run on and weave together. This will add to the depth and richness of the prose.\n* Use descriptive language: Employ vivid, evocative language to create a strong sense of atmosphere and setting. Focus on details that convey the nightmarishness, harshness, beauty, or complexity of the world and its inhabitants. Intensify the language to create a richer atmosphere and stronger sense of setting, particularly when describing the environment.\n* Sparing use of pronouns and names: Rely on context and the reader's understanding to convey who is speaking or being referred to.\n* Maintain a neutral, detached tone, dispassionate and objective, allow the reader to draw their own conclusions about the characters' emotions, motivations, and morality.\n* Convey emotions and thoughts indirectly: Show characters' feelings and thoughts through their actions, body language, or the environment, rather than stating them outright.\n* Create an atmosphere of tension and uncertainty: Allow the reader to sense the undercurrents of emotions, suspicions, and potential conflict between characters, without explicitly stating them.\n* Explore themes of brutality, cruelty, and struggle: Delve into the bleaker aspects of human nature, as well as the challenges and hardships faced by the characters\n* Use poetic prose: Write with a sense of poetry, incorporating rhythm, imagery, and symbolism to elevate the prose and create a more immersive reading experience.\n* Trust the reader's intelligence: Avoid over-explaining or spelling out every detail. Allow the reader to fill in the gaps and make connections based on the information provided in the text.\n* Utilize more archaic, ancient, biblical language, adding a sense of timelessness and gravitas to the narrative.\n* Incorporate more philosophical or existential musings into the narrative, weave larger themes and questions into the narrative.",

The Blacksmith, the fire dimmed in his forge, stepped out into the darkness, carrying on him the a lifetime of bitterness. He stood there, an empty silhouette amidst the vast expanse of the dark and indifferent cosmos. The glistening stars ignoring him cold, their distance and their divinity a sardonic rebuke to the tiny nothing of this one man‚Äôs soul.\n\n* Through the barren landscape, a storm approached, a harbinger of destruction, of cataclysm, sweeping away all that dared to defy its inexorable march. The wind tore at the earth, uprooting and scattering the dry dust, as if the land itself sought to escape its own desolation. The two, wrapped in tattered cloaks, forged ahead, their faces stung by biting sand, eyes squinted against the onslaught. The child held close, a fragile being in a merciless world, against the storm that sought to asunder each.\n\n* Shadows stretched long and thin in the dim light of the dying day, like fingers of some ancient god grasping out for the earth as the sun's last ember faded beneath the horizon. The Blacksmith and √âabha, their bodies weary and spirits worn, found a river, waters black as ink, coursing through the desolation. The murmur of it whispered tales of sorrow and hope, of life that clung to the edge of precipice."

There are bards. druids, craftspeople, and storytellers. some of whom provide comfort, storytelling, examples of human tenderness, beauty and insight. There is a mixture of Christianity and Celtic/Pagan beliefs. The truly ancient sacred and divine places (e.g. Newgrange) make the stories of a son of god (Christ) from a faraway land harder to take seriously. The narrator is aware of this tension, however most of the characters are untroubled by their mixed holding of these beliefs. Each side (christian / pagan) does have militants who can cause trouble for our protagonists, but their beliefs make them easy to manipulate, and in some cases their beliefs make them helpful. The book draws from the political, social and environmental history of Ireland in those years. It also draws from ancient Irish mythology. The growing port of Dublin (Dubh Linn), the building of Christchurch Cathedral there. The story The Cattle Raid of Cooley (T√°in B√≥ C√∫ailnge) dates back to the Iron Age, but its written form in Old Irish was likely created in the 11th or 12th century. It was a very popular epic tale of rivalry, war, and heroism"
