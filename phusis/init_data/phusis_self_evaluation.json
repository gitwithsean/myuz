            "Complexity: With multiple agents having various roles, goals, and traits, there's a risk of overwhelming the user with too much information or creating an overly complex system that is hard to manage and maintain.\n\nIntegration: Ensuring that all agents work together seamlessly and efficiently may pose challenges, especially if they have conflicting goals or ideas. It's important to consider how agents will communicate and collaborate with one another.\n\nRedundancy: Some agents may have overlapping roles or responsibilities, which could lead to redundancy in the system. It's essential to evaluate the necessity of each agent and consider whether combining or simplifying their roles could improve overall efficiency.\n\nUser experience: The user's ability to interact with and understand the system is crucial for the project's success. Ensuring that the user can easily access and control the various agents without feeling overwhelmed is important.\n\nAdaptability: As the project evolves, it's important to consider how the system can adapt to new requirements or changes in user needs. Building flexibility into the agent design will help the system remain relevant and useful over time.\n\nEvaluation: Establishing clear metrics for evaluating the performance and success of the agents is essential. This will help identify areas for improvement and ensure that the system continues to meet its goals.\n\nEthics and bias: With agents handling various creative and research-related tasks, it's crucial to consider the potential for ethical concerns or biases that may arise. Developing guidelines and safeguards to address these issues is important for a responsible and effective system.",
